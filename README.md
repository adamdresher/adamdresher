- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adamdresher
- ðŸ‘€ I'm just beginning my path to becoming a software developer and am focused on mastering the fundamentals of Ruby.  I'm currently studying with Launch School.
- ðŸŒ± I've committed myself to learning slowly, but consistently for the foreseeable future.

- Iâ€™m personally interested in helping out the community in any way I can.  Previously I ran a plastic recycling workshop to educate the community on the hidden impacts they and their trash have.  After proving myself as a capable programmer, I would like to dedicate some of my energy to help improve waste management systems.  
- I'm focusing all my time studying, but I'm always open to opporunities to gain experience.

- When I'm not studying, I'm with my dog exploring trails and beaches, reading about you name it, trying not to burn a new recipe, or seeing how many mosquitoes I can squash.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... adamdresher@gmail.com or on slack @Adam Dresher
