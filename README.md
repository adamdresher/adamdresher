- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamdresher
- 👀 I’m interested in ... helping out the community in any way I can.  At the moment, I'm a teacher and run a plastic recycling workshop on the weekends.  My goal is to become a developer so that one day I can help waste management systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Ruby fundamentals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... just about anything!  I'm eager to help and gain experience.  My university background is in art, mostly 2d/3d animation 2d/3d (fair warning- my current computer isn't capable of handling Maya).
- 📫 How to reach me ... adamdresher@gmail.com or on slack @Adam Dresher
