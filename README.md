- ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @adamdresher
- ðŸ‘€  My goal is to become a proficient software developer.  Currently I'm studying the fundamentals of Ruby with Launch School.

- Previously I ran a plastic recycling workshop to educate the community on the hidden impacts they and their trash have.  After proving myself as a capable programmer, I'd like to help address plastic waste.  It seems like an incredible waste of resources and a truly challenging problem.

- When I'm not studying, I'm with my dog exploring trails, reading, trying not to burn a new recipe, or meditating away the urge to squash a mosquito.
