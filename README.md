- ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @adamdresher
- ðŸ‘€  I'm focused becoming a proficient software developer.  Currently I'm mastering the fundamentals of Ruby with Launch School.

- Previously I ran a plastic recycling workshop to educate the community on the hidden impacts they and their trash have.  After proving myself as a capable programmer, I'd like to help address plastic waste.  It seems like an incredible waste of resources and a truly challenging problem.

- When I'm not studying, I'm with my dog exploring trails, reading, trying not to burn a new recipe, or seeing how many mosquitoes I can squash.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... adamdresher@gmail.com or on slack @Adam Dresher
